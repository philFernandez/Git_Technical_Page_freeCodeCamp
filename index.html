          A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as
          people and teams collaborate on projects together. As the project
          evolves, teams can run tests, fix bugs, and contribute new code with
          the confidence that any version can be recovered at any time.
          Developers can review project history to find out:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Which changes were made?</li>
          <li>Who made the changes?</li>
          <li>When were the changes made?</li>
          <li>Why were the changes made?</li>

        <p>
          Git is an example of a distributed version control system (DVCS)
          commonly used for open source and commercial software development.
          DVCSs allow full access to every file, branch, and iteration of a
          project, and allows every user access to a full and self-contained
          history of all changes. Unlike once popular centralized version
          control systems, DVCSs like Git don’t need a constant connection to a
          central repository. Developers can work anywhere and collaborate
          asynchronously from any time zone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without version control, team members are subject to redundant tasks,
          slower timelines, and multiple copies of a single project. To
          eliminate unnecessary work, Git and other VCSs give each contributor a
          unified and consistent view of a project, surfacing work that’s
          already in progress. Seeing a transparent history of changes, who made
          them, and how they contribute to the development of a project helps
          team members stay aligned while working independently.

          </a>
          , more than 70 percent of developers use Git, making it the most-used
          VCS in the world. Git is commonly used for both open source and
          commercial software development, with significant benefits for
          individuals, teams and businesses.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Git lets developers see the entire timeline of their changes,
            decisions, and progression of any project in one place. From the
            moment they access the history of a project, the developer has all
            the context they need to understand it and start contributing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Developers work in every time zone. With a DVCS like Git,
            collaboration can happen any time while maintaining source code
            integrity. Using branches, developers can safely propose changes to
            production code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Businesses using Git can break down communication barriers between
            teams and keep them focused on doing their best work. Plus, Git
            makes it possible to align experts across a business to collaborate
            on major projects.

        <header><h2>What's a repository?</h2></header>
        <p>
          A repository, or Git project, encompasses the entire collection of
          files and folders associated with a project, along with each file’s
          revision history. The file history appears as snapshots in time called
          commits, and the commits exist as a linked-list relationship, and can
          be organized into multiple lines of development called branches.
          Because Git is a DVCS, repositories are self-contained units and
          anyone who owns a copy of the repository can access the entire
          codebase and its history. Using the command line or other ease-of-use
          interfaces, a git repository also allows for: interaction with the
          history, cloning, creating branches, committing, merging, comparing
          changes across versions of code, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working in repositories keeps development projects organized and
          protected. Developers are encouraged to fix bugs, or create fresh
          features, without fear of derailing mainline development efforts. Git
          facilitates this through the use of topic branches: lightweight
          pointers to commits in history that can be easily created and
          deprecated when no longer needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through platforms like GitHub, Git also provides more opportunities
          for project transparency and collaboration. Public repositories help
          teams work together to build the best possible final product.
