        <p>
          A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as
          people and teams collaborate on projects together. As the project
          evolves, teams can run tests, fix bugs, and contribute new code with
          the confidence that any version can be recovered at any time.
          Developers can review project history to find out:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Which changes were made?</li>
          <li>Who made the changes?</li>
          <li>When were the changes made?</li>
          <li>Why were the changes made?</li>

        <header><h2>What's a distributed version control system?</h2></header>
        <p>
          Git is an example of a distributed version control system (DVCS)
          commonly used for open source and commercial software development.
          DVCSs allow full access to every file, branch, and iteration of a
          project, and allows every user access to a full and self-contained
          history of all changes. Unlike once popular centralized version
          control systems, DVCSs like Git don’t need a constant connection to a
          central repository. Developers can work anywhere and collaborate
          asynchronously from any time zone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without version control, team members are subject to redundant tasks,
          slower timelines, and multiple copies of a single project. To
          eliminate unnecessary work, Git and other VCSs give each contributor a
          unified and consistent view of a project, surfacing work that’s
          already in progress. Seeing a transparent history of changes, who made
          them, and how they contribute to the development of a project helps
          team members stay aligned while working independently.

        <p>
          According to the
          <a
            href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology"
            target="_blank"
          >
            latest Stack Overflow developer survey
          </a>
          , more than 70 percent of developers use Git, making it the most-used
          VCS in the world. Git is commonly used for both open source and
          commercial software development, with significant benefits for
          individuals, teams and businesses.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Git lets developers see the entire timeline of their changes,
            decisions, and progression of any project in one place. From the
            moment they access the history of a project, the developer has all
            the context they need to understand it and start contributing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Developers work in every time zone. With a DVCS like Git,
            collaboration can happen any time while maintaining source code
            integrity. Using branches, developers can safely propose changes to
            production code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Businesses using Git can break down communication barriers between
            teams and keep them focused on doing their best work. Plus, Git
            makes it possible to align experts across a business to collaborate
            on major projects.

      <section class="main-section" id="what's_a_repository?">
        <header><h2>What's a repository?</h2></header>
        <p>
          A repository, or Git project, encompasses the entire collection of
          files and folders associated with a project, along with each file’s
          revision history. The file history appears as snapshots in time called
          commits, and the commits exist as a linked-list relationship, and can
          be organized into multiple lines of development called branches.
          Because Git is a DVCS, repositories are self-contained units and
          anyone who owns a copy of the repository can access the entire
          codebase and its history. Using the command line or other ease-of-use
          interfaces, a git repository also allows for: interaction with the
          history, cloning, creating branches, committing, merging, comparing
          changes across versions of code, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working in repositories keeps development projects organized and
          protected. Developers are encouraged to fix bugs, or create fresh
          features, without fear of derailing mainline development efforts. Git
          facilitates this through the use of topic branches: lightweight
          pointers to commits in history that can be easily created and
          deprecated when no longer needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through platforms like GitHub, Git also provides more opportunities
          for project transparency and collaboration. Public repositories help
          teams work together to build the best possible final product.

      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="basic_git_commands">
        <header><h2>Basic Git commands</h2></header>
        <p>
          To use Git, developers use specific commands to copy, create, change,
          and combine code. These commands can be executed directly from the
          command line or by using an application like
          <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">
            GitHub Desktop
          </a>
          or Git Kraken. Here are some common commands for using Git:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>git init</code> initializes a brand new Git repository and
            begins tracking an existing directory. It adds a hidden subfolder
            within the existing directory that houses the internal data
            structure required for version control.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>git clone</code> creates a local copy of a project that
            already exists remotely. The clone includes all the project’s files,
            history, and branches.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>git add</code> stages a change. Git tracks changes to a
            developer’s codebase, but it’s necessary to stage and take a
            snapshot of the changes to include them in the project’s history.
            This command performs staging, the first part of that two-step
            process. Any changes that are staged will become a part of the next
            snapshot and a part of the project’s history. Staging and committing
            separately gives developers complete control over the history of
            their project without changing how they code and work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>git commit</code> saves the snapshot to the project history
            and completes the change-tracking process. In short, a commit
            functions like taking a photo. Anything that’s been staged with
            <code>git add</code> will become part of the snapshot with
            <code>git commit</code> .
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>git status</code> shows the status of changes as untracked,
            modified, or staged.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>git branch</code> shows the branches being worked on locally.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>git merge</code> merges lines of development together. This
            command is typically used to combine changes made on two distinct
            branches. For example, a developer would merge when they want to
            combine changes from a feature branch into the master branch for
            deployment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>git pull</code> updates the local line of development with
            updates from its remote counterpart. Developers use this command if
            a teammate has made commits to a branch on a remote, and they would
            like to reflect those changes in their local environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>git push</code> updates the remote repository with any commits
            made locally to a branch.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          GitHub is a Git hosting repository that provides developers with tools
          to ship better code through command line features, issues (threaded
          discussions), pull requests, code review, or the use of a collection
          of free and for-purchase apps in the GitHub Marketplace. With
          collaboration layers like the GitHub flow, a community of 15 million
          developers, and an ecosystem with hundreds of integrations, GitHub
          changes the way software is built.

      <section class="main-section" id="how_github_works">
        <header><h2>How GitHub works</h2></header>
        <p>
          GitHub builds collaboration directly into the development process.
          Work is organized into repositories, where developers can outline
          requirements or direction and set expectations for team members. Then,
          using the GitHub flow, developers simply create a branch to work on
          updates, commit changes to save them, open a pull request to propose
          and discuss changes, and merge pull requests once everyone is on the
          same page.

      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="the_github_flow">
        <header><h2>The GitHub flow</h2></header>
        <p>
          The GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow built around
          core Git commands used by teams around the globe—including ours.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GitHub flow has six steps, each with distinct benefits when
          implemented:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Create a branch:</b> Topic branches created from the canonical
            deployment branch (usually <code>master</code> ) allow teams to
            contribute to many parallel efforts. Short-lived topic branches, in
            particular, keep teams focused and results in quick ships.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Add commits:</b> Snapshots of development efforts within a branch
            create safe, revertible points in the project's history.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Open a pull request:</b> Pull requests publicize a project’s
            ongoing efforts and set the tone for a transparent development
            process.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Discuss and review code:</b> Teams participate in code reviews by
            commenting, testing, and reviewing open pull requests. Code review
            is at the core of an open and participatory culture.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Merge:</b> Upon clicking merge, GitHub automatically performs the
            equivalent of a local ‘git merge’ operation. GitHub also keeps the
            entire branch development history on the merged pull request.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Deploy:</b> Teams can choose the best release cycles or
            incorporate continuous integration tools and operate with the
            assurance that code on the deployment branch has gone through a
            robust workflow.
